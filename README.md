# Movie list task
1. Clone this repository
* The repo contains an incomplete application and a sample dataset.
* This application should display cards for each of the first 200 movies in the included JSON data file
* The user can click on “like” or “dislike” for each card, although this is not functional right now
* The application currently makes use of https://react.semantic-ui.com/, but feel free to change this if you'd prefer
2. Depending on your confidence, please choose and attempt a selection of the below tasks:
* Right now theres is bug stopping the application redering the results. Please fix this.
* Update the “like/dislike” button on the `MovieCard` component to change colour or style when clicked
* Refactor the application to separate the `Movies` and `MovieCard` components out into their own files
* Refactor the data filtering and mapping to its own function, seperate to the render
* Add a filter and corresponding UI element to the application, e.g. to enable users to filter the list based on release date or budget
* Add a UI component to set the number of results displayed, this is currently hardcoded to 200
* Convert one or more of the components to TypeScript
* Using whichever test library/framework you prefer, write some tests for your components
3.	When you are finished, add your modified files to a new private repository on Github, and invite the user `simonrradar` as a collaborator
